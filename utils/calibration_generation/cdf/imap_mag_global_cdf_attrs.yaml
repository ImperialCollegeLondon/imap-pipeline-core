  TEXT: >
    The IMAP magnetometer MAG consists of two vector magnetic field sensors
    which measure the magnetic field in the vicinity of the
    spacecraft. MAG will contribute to our understanding of the acceleration and transport
    of charged particles in the heliosphere, the dynamics of interplanetary shocks, and provide
    real time space weather measurements via the I-AliRT service.
    MAG design, assembly, operations, and calibration are led by Imperial
    College London. See

      The IMAP magnetometer requires dynamic calibration to remove the magnetic
      field of the spacecraft. The calibration matrices should be applied based
      on sensor and range and the offsets added based on sensor and range.
      The gradiometer factor should be used to calculate time varying offsets via gradiometry
      during the calibration process, and the spin averaging factors should be used
      to calculate time varying offsets.
